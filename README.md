## 🚀 Project Overview

Potato plants are vulnerable to various diseases that can significantly reduce yield and crop quality. Traditional manual inspection is time-consuming and error-prone. This system automates disease detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on a diverse dataset of potato leaf images.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Disease Identification**: Classify diseases from potato leaf images using CNNs.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Enable real-time field monitoring via remote sensing and ML.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze environmental data to predict disease outbreaks.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Create a simple web application for farmers.
- **Sustainable Agriculture**: Minimize chemical usage by providing early diagnosis.

## ✨ Features

- 📸 **Image Recognition** using CNN to detect Early Blight, Late Blight, or Healthy leaves.
- 📊 **Data Analysis** using machine learning algorithms and environmental data.
- 🌐 **Web Application** (Streamlit) to upload images and get results in real-time.
- 🧠 **Model Evaluation** with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- 🔁 **Image Preprocessing** with normalization, resizing, and augmentation.
- 🛠️ **Error Handling** for unsupported file types and upload issues.
